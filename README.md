# Study Guide WebPage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I created this webpage as a prework study guide for my MSU coding bootcamp. It has helped me to get a handle on the basics before the actual classes start. I actually have learned a lot even though it was only a guided text. During this project I learned how to take a basic website, and apply css and javascript techniques to overhaul the it.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
